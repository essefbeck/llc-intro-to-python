        # Today&rsquo;s project

        We're going to be a data scientist!

        Using open datasets from [open.canada.ca](http://open.canada.ca) we are going to learn to process, manipulate, and sort data.
        These kind of programs that 'parse' data are used frequently in web apps. For example the site [Open Parliment](https://openparliament.ca/).

        <!-- Computers are very good at repetitive tasks, but they require *precise instructions*. -->

        Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights from open data provided by The Government of Canada.

        <div class="presenter-notes">
          Whether you take these tools and apply them to your own data or keep using the tools you know, by the end of the day, you'll hopefully have greater confidence in leveraging computers to do your work faster and focus on what matters to you.

        * Programming is giving instructions to your computer to get it to do things for you
        * Computers need *very specific* instructions

        ## Running ruby in PyCharm

        The console is an interactive tool used to test and debug code and it&rsquo;s included in PyCharm!

        Let&rsquo;s open the console:

        ![Tools &gt; ruby Console&hellip;](./framework/img/workshop/open-console1.png)

        The console will pop up at the bottom of the application. ruby is now ready to do your bidding...

        ![ruby Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/open-console2.png)

        Now you can type code after the green `>>>` symbol. It is used by the console to represent a space for you to enter your input but you don&rsquo;t have to actually type it.  You can also open and close the console by selecting the icon in the lower right of PyCharm.
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Ruby can do math

        In the console, after the `>>>`, try out these examples.

        The command you input after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15
        30
        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0
        ```
        Why is `1 / 2 = 0`? We&rsquo;ll come back to that.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Data Types

        We just used the *integer* number **class** but there are many more.

        * Integer (whole numbers)
        * Float (numbers containing decimals)
        * String (words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (`True`, `False`)
        * [and many more!](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Data_types)
        * Use `.class` and a data value inside the parentheses to figure out the type.

        ```
        >>> "hello".class
        => String

        >>> 42.class
        => Fixnum

        >>> 3.14159.class
        => Float

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
        * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values
        * Ex. the `add` function takes `a` and `b` as arguments and will **return** the result

        ```ruby
        >>> def add(a, b)
        ...     return a + b
        ...     end
        ...
        >>> add(1, 2)
        3
        >>> add(3, 4)
        7
        ```

        We won't create our own functions in today's exercises, but we'll use those provided by ruby and its libraries.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Printing

        The 'puts' **function** outputs values to the screen.

        Functions at its most basic definition holds a set of instructions. More on functions later.

        Also, note the use of quotes.

        ```
        >>> puts "Hello World!"
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> puts 2 + 2
        4

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Printing

        We can also use the function 'print'.

        The difference between 'puts' and 'print' is 'puts' adds a new line to end of the output and 'print' does not.

        Lets try it in IRB!

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Concatenation
         You can "add" strings together, and that&rsquo;s called **concatenation**. It  joins multiple strings into one.
        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```
        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```ruby
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        TypeError: String can'/'t be coerced into Fixnum

        ```
      </script>
        <!-- I changed  because this is the error I get in IRB --TM -->
        <!-- Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'-->
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        ruby needs to know what **type** something is to figure out how to work with it.  Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.


        ```ruby
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        TypeError: String can&rsquo;t be coerced into Fixnum
        ```

        * The first `2`, inside of `print(2 + "2")` is an integer.
        * `"2"` enclosed in the quotes, is a **string** type, or "literal text".
        * ruby can&rsquo;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spits out an error.

      </script>
       <!-- Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'-->
    </section>

<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Typecasting-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

        We can tell ruby how to convert that `"2"` into a number and **change the type**. In this case, change the string to an integer (whole number) using the `int()` function.  Try it in your console.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + "2".to_i)
        4
        ```

        Now try dividing 2 numbers

        ```
        >>> print(1 / 2)
        0
        ```
        This happens because Ruby sees 2 integers and will return an integer.
        <br>

        Integer **classes** don&rsquo;t have decimal parts, so we have to convert to a more precise class, in this case **floats** since this number **class** can handle decimals.
        ```
        >>> print(1.to_f / 2.to_f)
        0.5
        ```

      </script>
       <!--  // We can also fix the `1/2 = 0` error in the previous example.
        // When ruby divides two integers, it doesn&rsquo;t know that the answer isn&rsquo;t an integer so it gets confused. -->
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting (Continued)

        ruby can also be used to convert numbers to strings.

        ```
        >>> print(99 + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        TypeError: String cant be coerced into Fixnum

        ```
        Use the `.to_s` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        >>> print(99.to_s + " bottles of beer on the wall")

        ```

        The ability to tell ruby to change the type will come in handy later.

      </script>
    </section>


<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Variables-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables
        * In programming, we usually want to store a value to use later
        * Variables store data in your computer&rsquo;s memory and you use a **variable name** to fetch their value (kind of like a bookmark in a book)
        * Use the equal (`=`) symbol to assign a value to a variable

        ```ruby
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```ruby
        >>> today = "Saturday"
        >>> print("Today is " + today)
        Today is Saturday
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after you&rsquo;ve assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```ruby
        # Remember, we've already set x = 5 and y = 4
        >>> y = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">50</span>

        Why?
        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.
        ruby will remember variable names until you close PyCharm or [clear them manually](https://docs.ruby.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement).
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## What's in a name?

        * Variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`); no spaces
        * In ruby, you separate words with the `_`; ex. `ladies_learning_code`
        * They cannot begin with a number; `1day` gives you an error while `day1` is fine
        * The names we&rsquo;ll use today are descriptive, but otherwise have no special meaning to ruby
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Pro Tip! Use Comments

        * Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future)
        * Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious
        * You&rsquo;ll see more comments throughout the exercises
        * Feel free to add your own!

<!-- Exercise 1: Hello World -->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World

        We&rsquo;ve already used the console to put a 'Hello World' message on the screen, so why not take it one step further and have ruby say hello to anyone?

        ruby has a `gets` method that gets data typed by a user and **returns** that value to you.

        ruby returns the value with a `\n` appended to the input.  This is ruby putting a new line after the input.  We add the method `chomp` to remove this.  `chomp` removes the last character of a string.


        1. You give a `puts` message to let your user know what you&rsquo;re looking for
        1. You write a variable and assign the value of `gets` to it (you add `chomp` to remove the new line character)
        1. The user types something and hits the **enter** key
        1. Whatever the user types is **returned** to you.

        Let&rsquo;s try it in your console:

        ```ruby
        >>> puts "What's your name?"
        ```
        It outputs `What''s your name?`

        ```ruby
        >>> name = gets.chomp
        ```

        We assign the value of what is gotten to the name variable

        You type in your name, press **enter**, and it will print it out on the next line.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Typing into the console is fine to start, but do you really want to type your program every time you run it?

        ruby can run your code from a file with a `.rb` **extension**
        *(<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->the letters after `.` in a filename tell your computer which program can run it)*

        Let&rsquo;s create our first ruby file!

        1. Open Atom and choose ***New File*** from the ***File*** menu. Then choose ***Save as...*** from the file menu.

          ![Create a new ruby File](./framework/img/workshop/saving-ruby-file.png)

        1. Enter the name `hello.rb` in the popup box.

          ![new ruby file name](framework/img/workshop/new-ruby-file.png)

        1. Now we can add our simple program to the file

          ```ruby
          # Ask user for input
          # Assign the input value to a variable
          # Your program waits for the user to hit enter
          print "Please enter your name: "
          name = gets.chomp

          # … then continues to this line
          print("Hello " + name)
          ```

        Now how do we use the `Terminal` to run this file?
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 3)

        Code in a file is just text until you **run** it through the ruby program.

        1. Open up your `Terminal` and move to the location your file is saved

        ## Conditionals &amp; Logic
        * The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom
        * What if the program could act differently and decide what to do?
        * Use conditionals like an `if` statement
        * Each `if` statement contains a test, and the indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True` but not if it is `False` and looks something like this:

        ```ruby
        # Not real code
        if it is cold outside
            wear a sweater
        else
            dress normally :)
        end

        You can also have more than one condition.

        ## Boolean values

        How does `if` know what&rsquo;s `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```ruby
        >>> weather = "raining"
        ```

        Test the values. The double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"
        True
        ```
        We can use these *statements* with our `if` values to test for our weather conditions

        ## Indentation

        ruby uses indentation to figure out which 'block' of code belongs inside the `if` or `else`.

        When you're typing out examples that use an `if` or `else` in the console, you'll see this:

        ```ruby
        >>> if weather == "cold":
        ... ̺̺̺̺
        ```

        The `...` and auto-indentation is the console signalling that it expects the nested block code.
        When you're done, press enter twice (or backspace and type `else:` and you'll get your next indented block).

        ```ruby
        >>> if weather == "cold":

        ## String Interpolation

        ruby uses string Interpolation to add variables to strings for output.

        When you want to print results ruby needs a way of knowing what is meant to be the exact word and what is meant to be a variable.

        ```ruby
        >>> if weather == "cold"
              print "the weather today is #{weather}"
            end
        ```

        The `#{weather}` tells ruby to use the variable weather, rather than just outputing the word 'weather'.
        Try typing each example into the command line.

        ```ruby
        >>> weather = "cold"
        >>> print "the weather today is weather"

        `<`: Less than
        `>=`: Greater than or equal to
        `<=`: Less than or equal to

        ## Opening a file

        We typically store computer data in files. The data in some files is human-readable text (while in others, like images, it&rsquo;s in a format that&rsquo;s only readable by programs with specific code to interpret the data).

        It&rsquo;s fairly easy in ruby to open a human-readable file and print the contents to the screen.

        ```ruby
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.read())
        # … lots of file data …
        >>> chapters.close()
        # When you're done with a file it's a good idea to close it

        ## One line at a time

        In order to make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.

        In the `llc-chapters.csv` file, each line of the file represents a Ladies Learning Code Chapter

        Let&rsquo;s print out a few individual lines

        ```ruby
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Calgary,AB,Darcie

        >>> chapters.close()

        ## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.

        ```
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```

        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma (`,`)

        The first line doesn&rsquo;t tell us about a chapter, it has headings than describe the data in the next lines

        The second and third line each represent one of the LLC chapters.

        This is a specific *file format* called **CSV** (short for *comma-separated values*) that is used to represent spreadsheet-like data

        This is a widely used file-format because it&rsquo;s such a simple representation of rows and columns of data. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re on a Mac, Windows, Linux or even on a web app like Google Docs – everyone can use this data.

        It&rsquo;s all well and good to print out the lines in a file one-at-a-time while you&rsquo;re learning, but surely, there&rsquo;s a better way to read *all* the lines in a file.

        In programming, when you want to perform the same action many times in a row, we use **loops**. In ruby, the main kind of loop is the `for` loop.

        If we want to print each of the rows in our file, we can use the following code:

        ```ruby
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> for line in chapters:
        ...     print(line)
        ...

      <script type="text/template">
        ## `for` loop behind the scenes

        If you play around with the `chapters` variable in your console, you might notice that it has a `.next()` function which does the same thing as `.readline()`

        `for` can work with many different collections of data, all it&rsquo;s looking for is that `.next()` function.

        Behind the scenes, it&rsquo;s doing something roughly like

        ```ruby
        line = chapters.next()
        # Execute your code block
        # …
        # Go back to get the next value and repeat until there are no more values
        ```

        We&rsquo;ll use the `for` loop in our future exercises to work with a larger file.

        In ruby, you can **import** the functions and other structures from a **module** so you can use the code without having it in your file. Then you can use functions (and other structures) from that **module** to do your bidding!

        In your console, import the `csv` library as follows.

        ```ruby
        >>> import csv
        ```

        If you then type `csv.` and wait, it will show you a list of everything in that module.

        ## Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV libary has a number of different tools for extracting actual data from a CSV file. Instead of a line of comma-separated values, we can access individual values easily (like the cells of a spreadsheet).

        Today we&rsquo;ll mostly use the `DictReader` tool because it's easier to understand the data in each row (without remembering anything about the headings)

        * First we open the file
        * Then, we import the `csv` library
        * Then we pass the file into `DictReader` to make sense of it

          ```
          >>> import csv
          >>> chapters_file = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
          >>> chapters_data = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
          ```
        * Now, we can pull out one row at a time

          ```
          >>> chapter = chapters_data.next()
          >>> print(chapter)
          {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}

        ```ruby

        * We group instructions together with the same indentation

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened.

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. ruby processes everything to the right of the `=` before assignining the result.

        ```ruby
        >>> count = 0
        >>> count = count + 1
        >>> print(count)
        1

        ## Finding a word in a string

        So far, we've compared entire strings to each other `"ruby" == "ruby"`.

        But what if you want to find a word inside an existing string?

        ruby has a `.find()` function available on `str` types that tells you where another string appears – its **index**.

        ```ruby
        >>> "Ladies Learning Code".find("Code")
        16
        >>> title = "National Learn to Code Day"
        >>> title.find("Code")
        18
        >>> title.find("code")
        -1

        The `.find()` function is case-sensitive – it will only match the *exact* string you pass it, even if the only difference is `C` vs `c`.

        ## Exercise 5: Find chapters with co-leads (15 mins)

        Now that you know how to find a string within a string, we can figure out which cities have co-leads.

        If you open the **llc-chapters.csv** file you can see that we *always* use the `&` character to separate co-lead names.

        Remember, `.find()` returns the index of the search string in the other string **or** `-1` to signal nothing was found. We can use the `>=` operator to determine if the string was found as shown below:

        ```ruby
        >>> leads = "Nancy & Cassie"
        >>> if leads.find("&") >= 0:
        ...     print(leads + " are co-leads")
        ...
        Nancy & Cassie are co-leads
        ```

        Create a new file **ex5_coleaders.py** and use what you've learned to find co-leaders.

        * Print a list of cities with co-leads
        * Count how many chapters have co-leads

        ## Going bigger

        So far, we've kept the examples small so you can look at the CSV file yourself and see the patterns.

        In 2014, Ladies Learning Code had nearly 6500 participants and volunteers involved in events (not accounting for people who attended multiple events).

          Do you want to count those?

          ![Nope, not doing that.](http://33.media.tumblr.com/11c6f192a380836be3282b4777addc32/tumblr_mumzzcS9Ug1s410g9o1_500.gif)

        ## Final Exercise

        Out of curiousity we are going to take a look at historical rent prices using data from [Open.canada.ca.](http://open.canada.ca/)

        * Filter the data for rows that have a number in the "Value" column.
        * Find the average of "One bedroom units" in a province of your choice.
        * Find the difference in pricing for "One bedroom units" in the 1980s versus the 1990s in that area.

        ## Things we didn't cover

        ### Writing results to a CSV file

        * Just like `DictReader` there's a `DictWriter` in the csv package
        * Gather data then write out the headers and data to a file
        * Useful for filtering a big set of data down to something you can analyse in a spreadsheet program
        * See `reference/bonus_writing_csv.py`

        ### Reading files in other languages (like French)

        * ruby 2.x defaults to ASCII (very basic letters and numbers)
        * Most text on the internet with accents or foreign characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.) are represented in [unicode](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding.en)
        * You can install the [unicodecsv](https://pypi.ruby.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.13.0) package with [pip](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-ruby/) and it will read and write CSV files containing accents and other characters
